# Loan Approval Prediction

This project focuses on predicting loan approvals. The algorithm for making predictions is Random Forest.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling of missing values, encoding of categorical data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualiztion of key trends and relationships in the dataset.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Implemetation of multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy and ROC-AUC evaluation.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Libraries:
  - Pandas
